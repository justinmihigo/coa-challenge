# COA-Challenges

### Description
- This repo contains three simple challenges
    1. [Gallery](#gallery)
    2. [Array map](#array-map)
    3. [String manipulation](#gallery) 
- the goal for this challenges is to showcase our skills and how we are confident to use simple web technologies which are HTML, CSS, and JS.

#### Gallery
- For the gallery app, the task is to display the images as in the figma and adding interactivity and responsiveness on the images. 
- Technologies used
    1. HTML
    2. CSS for styling
    3. JS for adding other functionality like event listeners

- How this can be tested
    1. clone the repo and 
    2. go to the image-gallery ```image-gallery```
    3. run index.html
    or
    1. clone the repo
    2. with vs code browse index.html if you have liveserver run it, it will automatically run the file
    3. To view image with increased width click it, if you click it twice you will shrink it back.

#### Array Map
- For this challenge, you are given an array and the output has to be true if there is a subarray that sums to a target number
- Technlogies used: JS
- How this can be tested
    1. clone the repo 
    2. change the directory go to challenges ```cd challenges```
    3. use node to run the file ```node arrayMap.js```

#### String Transformation
- For this challenge, the string is manipulated according to its length if
    1. the length is divisible by 3
        - we reverse the string.
    2. the length is divisible by 5
        - we change each character of a string with its ascii code.
    3. the length is divisible by 3 and 5 
        - we do both changing to ascii code and reversing the string.
- Technlogies used: JS
- How this can be tested
    1. clone the repo 
    2. change the directory go to challenges ```cd challenges```
    3. use node to run the file ```node stringTransform.js```
